Here’s a short, **professional** `README.md` for your project:

# CodeVisualizer

**CodeVisualizer** is a web-based platform where you can **write code**, **dry-run it**, and **visualize** its internal structure — including **AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)**, **CFG (Control Flow Graph)**, and **LLVM IR**.

It combines the power of the **Monaco Editor** (used in Visual Studio Code) with a custom-built **compiler backend** to give a full view of how code is parsed, structured, and executed step-by-step.

---

## ✨ Features

- Full **Monaco Editor** for writing and editing code
- **Run** code manually by clicking a button
- **Output Panel** for displaying compiled/run output
- **AST Viewer** for exploring the parse tree structure
- **CFG Viewer** for seeing control flow between operations
- **LLVM IR Viewer** to inspect low-level code generation
- **Dry Runner** to simulate code execution step-by-step (Coming Soon)
